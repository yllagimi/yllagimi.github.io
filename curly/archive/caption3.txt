Fame usually knocks. But for 19-year-old Mary Kate Cornett, it barreled through the front door like a drunken goose, courtesy of an offhand joke on Pat McAfee’s podcast. McAfee, a man who seems like he was raised by energy drinks and group chats, aired a wink-wink tale of a frat guy, his girlfriend, and the guy’s dad. No names were named, but in our delightful digital dystopia, all you need is “Kappa Delta” and a whiff of scandal. The Internet will do the rest.

Within 90 minutes, Cornett was being stared at on campus like she’d walked into class wearing a live goat. Her name trended, memes were minted, and strangers online decided she’d committed the unforgivable crime of existing. The rumor? That she slept with her boyfriend’s dad. She says she didn’t. No one asked.

Cornett’s phone blew up with messages ranging from disgusting to death threats. Her dorm became a panic bunker. Her mother’s house was even swatted—yes, SWAT teams, as if she were Professor X with a criminal mind.

Meanwhile, Barstool bros chimed in, even using her name for a meme coin because apparently shame is now a business model.

Now, with an attorney in tow and a father demanding justice (sweet, naïve man), Cornett wants people to understand: she didn’t sign up for this. She was just a student. A nobody. Until, suddenly, she wasn’t.

Her story is a cautionary tale: in the age of viral content, anyone can be next. And fame? It’s rarely a gift.
