There’s a particular kind of fame that arrives without warning, like a pigeon through a glass window. Mary Kate Cornett, a 19-year-old Ole Miss student, didn’t ask for fame, nor did she trip into it while trying to go viral on TikTok. No, hers was bestowed upon her by the gods of Internet Gossip, aided by ESPN’s very own chaos goblin, Pat McAfee.

Now, if you're unfamiliar with McAfee, imagine if a football player and a can of Monster Energy had a baby, and that baby grew up and started yelling rumors into a microphone. On his show, he giggled through a secondhand tale of a fraternity boy, his girlfriend, and a father—no names, just winks and innuendo. But in the Internet age, you don’t need a name. Just say “Kappa Delta” and “dad,” and the mob will do the rest.

Within 90 minutes, Cornett says she couldn’t walk through campus without being stared at. Her name trended on X (formerly known as Twitter, but let’s be honest, it’s like calling Prince “The Artist”), and she became the unwilling protagonist in a Reddit soap opera. Her “role”? The girl who allegedly slept with her boyfriend’s dad.

She says it never happened. No one asked if it did. And McAfee? Still hasn’t called.

Cornett says her life imploded. Her dorm became a panic room. She dropped in-person classes. Her phone wouldn’t stop buzzing with messages that ranged from lewd to lethal. Strangers told her to die. Her mom’s house got swatted—yes, police with guns drawn, as if a teenage girl can commit crimes with her mind.

And all because some guy in a podcast hoodie thought a dirty rumor was “content.”

But this isn’t just about McAfee. Barstool Sports alumni joined in, including one who turned the debacle into a cryptocurrency. Because when life gives you scandal, you mint a meme coin.

Her father, Justin, who sounds like the type who still believes in concepts like dignity and justice, now wants accountability. “If this happened to his daughter,” he said, referring to McAfee, “he wouldn’t be laughing.” Which is both fair and terribly naïve. Men like McAfee always find a new laugh track.

Mary Kate wants the world to know she wasn’t chasing clout. She was a freshman. She had friends. She liked being anonymous. Now she has an attorney. Possibly a lawsuit. And a reminder for the rest of us: the Internet is a meat grinder, and none of us are special cuts.

So the next time you see a juicy rumor floating by on X or a podcast clip making the rounds, ask yourself—who benefits, and who gets eaten alive?

Because, as Cornett told NBC, “This could happen to anyone.” And, in 2024, that may be the scariest sentence imaginable.
