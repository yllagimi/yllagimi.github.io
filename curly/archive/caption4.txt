Pierce Brosnan, the suavest of former Bonds and the dreamboat of moms everywhere, has bestowed his shaken-not-stirred blessing on Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a potential 007. According to Brosnan, Taylor-Johnson would be “very good”—which, in Hollywood speak from a man who’s worn a tux while driving a tank, basically means “get this man a martini and a franchise.”

The two worked together years ago on *The Greatest* (a family drama, not a Muhammad Ali biopic), where Brosnan remembers Taylor-Johnson “filling the space with passion,” which either means he was impressive or Brosnan forgot his name and needed a compliment.

Brosnan gave a polite “I wish them well” to Amazon MGM, the new stewards of Bond, which is the verbal equivalent of smiling through clenched teeth at your ex’s engagement party.

He’s now starring in *MobLand*, playing a brooding Irish crime boss opposite Helen Mirren and Tom Hardy—who, it turns out, barely spoke to Brosnan on set but is apparently a lovely man with strong Rottweiler energy (Brosnan’s words, almost).

Everyone in *MobLand* is heaping praise on each other like it’s the last day of summer camp, and it’s kind of sweet—blood, betrayal, and British accents aside.

As for Taylor-Johnson stepping into the Bond tux? He’s got the jawline, the vibe, and Pierce’s blessing. And in the Bond universe, that’s basically a royal decree—with better suits.
