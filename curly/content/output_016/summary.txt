Well, I must say, there's nothing quite like the thrill of watching paint dry, or, as it so happens, the suspense of a Marvel live stream unveiling the cast of their latest movie, "Avengers: Doomsday." Shown over a glacial five and a half hours, one could have cooked a turkey, knitted a sweater, or, in my case, pondered the existential angst of one's place in the universe while waiting for the names to be revealed one by one on directors' chairs. 

The spectacle, or, dare I say, performance art, was not lost on the movie's stars Florence Pugh and David Harbour. Like a pair of Dickens' characters, they too were suspended in a state of delicious uncertainty, unsure if they had even made the cut. 

In an Instagram interview, Pugh confessed of the marathon reveal, "I mean, I just couldn't believe it was going on for so long. I went to make a cup of tea and when I came back it was still going on." A cup of tea? My dear Florence, one could have brewed an entire farm's worth of tea in that time. 

Harbour, in a moment of solidarity with every average Joe and Jane, shared his confusion, "Okay, I get it, Paul Ruddâ€™s in this movie. Am I in this movie?" His name showed up two hours into the live stream. Two hours! That's like waiting for a bus in a small town on a Sunday afternoon. 

What started as a grand marketing coup by Marvel, quickly devolved into a study of patience, speculation, and complete chaos. The live stream, a social media sensation, had fans theorizing, memeing, and in some cases, live-blogging. While the approach was contentious, it sure kept viewers glued until the very end, including, ironically, the very people who were in the movie.

"Avengers: Doomsday" is set to premiere on May 1, 2026. If the personalities of Pugh and Harbour are anything to go by, the movie promises to be a riot. In the meantime, keep your tea warm and next time, maybe give Florence and David a little heads-up, Marvel.
