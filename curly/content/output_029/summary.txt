I must say, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett has ruffled some feathers, something I find myself doing in my own family. After she dared to partially agree with a dissenting opinion from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Trump's supporters have gone into a bit of a tizzy. 

The argument was about where the case should be made for some Venezuelan detainees. Sotomayor felt that the government couldn't just smuggle anyone onto a plane and whisk them back to their home country under a cloak of secrecy. Barrett chimed in with a meek "I concur." You'd think she'd committed high treason. 

Even Senator Mike Lee, a stalwart Republican from Utah, expressed disappointment on social media. It was like he had walked in on his wife eating his secret stash of Oreos. A sentiment Elon Musk inflated appallingly by comparing Barrett's compassion to a risk to civilisation. 

The venomous outcry from Trump loyalists on social media was comical. They ranted on about Barrett enabling cartels in America. One account with a whopping 3.5 million followers even had the gall to label her as "Amy Commie Barrett." It was like a bad episode of "House of Cards."

The whole episode is pure, unadulterated theatre. Barrett, a staunch conservative who once threw her weight behind the overturning of Roe v. Wade, is now being accused of high treason for showing an ounce of compassion. I mean, what's next? Excommunication for sneezing during the Pledge of Allegiance?

Barrett's conservatism hasn't exactly been a secret. When Trump first nominated her, people looked at her record and concluded she was leaning so far right she could topple over. But the same folks also predicted she might occasionally break ranks and boy, haven't they been proven right!

To these Trump loyalists, loyalty to their kingpin is the only virtue that matters. You could be as conservative as a Victorian headmaster and it wouldn't make a jot of difference if you dared to disagree with Trump. Just ask Liz Cheney.

Ultimately, this is a tale of misplaced expectations, unrealistic demands, and a whole lot of frothing at the mouth. Barrett, a Supreme Court Justice with a lifetime appointment, still has a long career ahead of her. As for the frothing MAGA mob, they'll just have to sit back and bear it, which is sure to make for some delightful viewing.
