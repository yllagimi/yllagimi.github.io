If Kafka had written for the tabloids, he might've dreamed up Russell Brand’s week. Once a scruffy British export best known for doing unspeakable things to hair gel and starring in movies with titles like *Get Him to the Greek*, Brand is now facing a pile of criminal charges so serious even his man bun flinched.

London’s Metropolitan Police charged him with rape, indecent assault, oral rape (which sounds as clinical as it does horrifying), and multiple sexual assaults, all spanning from 1999 to 2005. It's the sort of rap sheet that makes your IMDb page look like a confession.

In true Brand fashion, he responded with a video on X (which used to be Twitter, until Elon gave it a shave and a midlife crisis), declaring he was many things—an addict, a sex maniac, a world-class twit—but not, he insists, a rapist. “Never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he says, as if the phrase had a frequent flyer program.

Authorities opened the investigation after the Times of London and Channel 4 aired a documentary detailing allegations from four women. One of them says she was 16 when their relationship started—emotionally and sexually abusive, she says, with Brand allegedly forcing himself on her so aggressively she choked. Another woman says he raped her in L.A. in 2012, a city not known for its modesty but even there, that’s too much.

Brand’s career took a nosedive faster than a BuzzFeed quiz load time: his talent agency dumped him, his comedy tour was canceled, and the only thing still running was his mouth—mostly on YouTube and Rumble, where he now delivers populist rants that smell suspiciously of cologne and conspiracy theories.

Once married to Katy Perry and now living in Florida, he’s gone from rom-coms to Ron DeSantis country, leaning hard into right-wing fandom like a man clutching a MAGA hat in a wind tunnel.

He's due in court May 2. Until then, he's probably vlogging.
