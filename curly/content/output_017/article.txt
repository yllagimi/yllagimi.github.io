Shannon Elizabethhad hearts racing in 1999 asAmerican Pie's beautiful exchange student Nadia. But in recent years, the actress has found meaning in another passion project.

Speaking to the crowd at Steel City Con in Pittsburgh on April 5, Elizabeth said she moved to South Africa eight years ago to work on her conservation charity, theShannon Elizabeth Foundation.

"We're building a sanctuary," she revealed. "We have a blind black rhino we've been taking care of, and we're going to bring in more rhinos as soon as we can do an expansion."

AfterAmerican Pie,she said, "I started my charity, which was called Animal Avengers at the time. And it's been going since then, it's just morphed over the years into conservation and wildlife from dogs and cats."

Elsewhere in the panel, which also featured costarMena Suvari, Elizabeth recalled working on Nadia's accent in the studio, trying voiceovers both with and without the inflection.

"After that whole exercise, I didn't know what they were going to choose," she said. "All of my friends were like, 'So how was it?' I was like, 'This movie is going to suck ... they're messing with the accent.' I had no idea!"

Suvari, 46, said she believes the magic of the movie came from "capturing those classic moments" from high school.

Coming back forAmerican Reunionwas "a lot of fun," Suvari added. "For me personally, because I was just in a completely different space so I was able to really appreciate and really understand the opportunity we had and what this meant coming back together."

As the original film turned 25 in 2024, starJason Biggssaid that what "time has given me is perspective and real appreciation for the impact that the movie has had around the world.
