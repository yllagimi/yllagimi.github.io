So, Elon Musk and Trump are having a spat over tariffs. Usually, they're singing from the same hymn sheet about world trade problems, but when it comes to solutions, they're singing completely different tunes. It's like watching two alley cats fighting over a can of tuna. Musk's been throwing insults at Trump's trade advisor, calling him a "moron" - must be a new form of diplomacy I haven't heard of before. All this fuss because Musk doesn't want his Tesla parts to cost more. He's all about that "gigafactory" model, keeping everything under one roof - probably so he can keep an eye on it. But this tariff stuff? It's like watching two bald men fight over a comb.
