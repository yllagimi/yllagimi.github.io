If there's one person who knows how to create a buzz, it's Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex. She launched her new lifestyle brand, As Ever, on April 2 at 9 a.m. and by 9:59, every last herbal tea, baking mix, and the rest of her eight-product line was sold out. It's as if the world was waiting with bated breath for a chance to get their hands on a bit of Duchess-domesticity.

Taking a page from her Netflix series, With Love, Meghan, the collection was her take on "montecito magic." I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it sounds delightful. Maybe it's the kind of magic that makes raspberry spread taste like caviar or turns wildflower honey into liquid gold.

The debut morning was marked with a heartfelt message from Markle herself, welcoming everyone to the brand and promising it's "just the beginning." Who knows, maybe next we'll be seeing Duchess-branded tiaras and scepters.

Now, our Duchess has faced some flack for her post-royal lifestyle being a bit "out of touch," but she insists that her life hasn't always been a whirl of cooking, entertaining, and curating collections. She wants us to know she's no culinary queen. Her kitchen, complete with two "mostly dormant" pizza ovens, is more like a stage where she occasionally performs. Her attempt at baking sourdough bread was "boring" and "traumatic." Well, join the club, Meghan.

Before it was known as As Ever, the brand was called American Riviera Orchard. But a few trademark issues later, it was reborn with the name that signifies continuity and tradition. It's a return to her roots, in a way. It's reminiscent of her pre-royal, pre-Harry days when she ran a lifestyle blog, The Tig.

As Ever seems to have rekindled the spark in Prince Harry's eyes. Watching Meghan in her element, scribbling away, and fine-tuning her brand is like a trip down memory lane for him. It's the Meghan he fell for. 

While fans are waiting for the next As Ever collection, they can tune in to Markle's new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, launching on April 8. She'll be sharing insights on building a business, while she, too, builds her own brand, As Ever. A Duchess, a lifestyle guru, and now a podcast host - is there anything Meghan Markle can't do?
