Picture this: Matthew Broderick, perhaps best known for his truancy in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," has gone from play-acting sick to playing dad. And not just to any kids, but to the offspring of Sarah Jessica Parker, a woman so fashionable her heel collection probably warrants its own zip code.

Now, with such a high pedigree, you'd think their kids would be tripping over themselves to follow in their thespian footsteps. But not quite.

Their 13-year-old daughter, named either Tabitha Hodge or Marion Loretta Elwell (your guess is as good as mine), has a strong aversion to acting. Bring up the idea, and she’d probably rather scrub the bathroom floor with a toothbrush than entertain the thought of treading the boards. 

On the flip side, their son, James Wilkie, 22, has stars in his eyes. He's smart, according to Broderick, and sports an education that could land him a job anywhere from a tech startup to a think tank. But acting? That's his jam, at least for now. 

"We're supportive," says Broderick with what I imagine to be a shrug. Not the sort of support that involves lavish praise and standing ovations, but more of the "we'll help you with your audition tape and tell you when it's rubbish" variety. Constructive criticism, they call it. I call it maintaining family harmony.

Speaking of auditions, Parker, when not advising on shoe choices, lends a hand reading lines with James. Ah, family quality time, nothing like it. 

In 2023, Parker aired her thoughts on the whole 'kids earning their keep' concept. And I don't just mean making their bed or taking out the trash. No, Parker wants them to grasp the concept of hard work and understand the value of a dollar – or in their case, a few million of them.

Their needs are covered; they're warm, safe, fed, and loved. But she also wants them to yearn for something, to have goals. And whether those goals involve Hollywood stardom or scrubbing bathroom floors, well, that's up to them. 

What’s that they say about the apple falling far from the tree? Sometimes it takes a good old leap.
