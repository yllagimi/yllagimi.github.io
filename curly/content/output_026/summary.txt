Well, there I was, enjoying my morning coffee, when the latest tiff between Elon Musk and the Trump administration rudely interrupted my serenity. The world's richest man and Trump, his less-wealthy, more-tan counterpart, usually make beautiful music together about world trade woes, but their duet has hit quite the sour note. Musk, armed with a metaphorical thesaurus, hurled a barrage of insults at Trump's trade guru, Peter Navarro, including the delightful zinger, “truly a moron.” 

Navarro, you see, had claimed Tesla despises tariffs because it needs foreign parts. Musk, who has structured his company around the "gigafactory" model to limit trade, took umbrage. I know I would, especially if I were the mastermind behind a company that's, as Musk put it, "the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America." 

Musk, usually a quiet wallflower about tariffs, has voiced his distaste for the global trading system's rough edges, which Trump has christened non-monetary barriers. Musk dreams of a "zero-tariff" utopia between the US and Europe, while Trump holds tariffs close to his chest like a beloved teddy bear.

Trump, for instance, has dismissed the idea of zero-for-zero tariffs, arguing matters such as trade deficits need change. It's as if someone offered him a free steak dinner and he said, "No, that's not enough; I need a side of fries and a chocolate milkshake too."

Meanwhile, Musk has been irked by trade nuances that sting his businesses, particularly pesky value-added taxes (VATs) that inflate Tesla car prices overseas. Trump has also harped on about non-tariff barriers like VATs, calling them "far more punitive than a tariff." 

Musk's brother, Kimbal, has been equally vocal, labeling Trump the "most high tax American President in generations.” But with Trump’s grand "Liberation Day" plans in the works, Musk seems to be seeing red more than ever.

As for me, I just hope someone will buy the next round of tariffs a one-way ticket to Mars.
