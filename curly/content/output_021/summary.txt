So, you know when you’re watching one of those FBI shows, and you’re half-surprised that the main characters are swapping spit instead of arresting criminals? Well, let me tell you, "FBI: International’s" latest episode had me in a similar huff. 

Here I was, innocently observing the exploits of the Fly Team's newest SSA, Wes Mitchell - a fresh face on the block, replacing Luke Kleintank's oh-so-memorable, Scott Forrester. Then bam! Before I know it, there's the potential of romance blooming between Wes and Amanda Tate. A love story, really? Can't we stick to the bullets and bad guys?

I hate to burst the bubble of any fans hoping to see this romance blossom, but unfortunately, the series got the chop. That's right, 'International' and 'FBI: Most Wanted' both got axed in March, and I'm still reeling from the shock. Now, they’re moving on with 'FBI: CIA', and I can't help but feel like I’m grappling with TV show abandonment. 

So there I was, watching the latest episode, "Little Angel", expecting nothing but crime-solving, and then, to my surprise, we're seeing a semi-drunk Wes opening up about his past with Amanda. I’m thinking, "Okay, this is a bit more Grey's Anatomy than FBI, but alright…" 

But then, Wes makes a quip about HR bursting in like ninjas if Amanda enters his apartment, and that's when I sense the electricity in the air. I'm half-expecting - and half-hoping - there won't be a kiss because Wes is well-oiled. 

Of course, this isn't my first rodeo with misreading the romantic intentions of a Jesse Lee Soffer character. Remember when I was convinced Halstead would never kiss Upton? How silly of me! 

Anyway, only time will tell if this will turn into an actual thing or if I’m just seeing smoke where there's no fire. So, while I sit here, hypothesizing about fictional characters' love lives, you can catch the remaining episodes of 'FBI: International' on CBS or rewatch older ones on Paramount+. Trust me, it's more fun than it sounds.
