Picture this: it's Dove Cameron, the cooing songbird of the Disney universe, perched on the armchair of Dax Shepard's podcast, peeling back her layered emotions like stubborn panelling. With a career that catapulted her into 900 million homes in the time it takes to say “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious," one can't help but sympathize when she admits, "I couldn't have prepared."

She talks about her dual role in Disney’s "Liv and Maddie" and how she found herself more introverted than expected. Apparently, the deafening roar of fan attention is a bit like a surprise party where everyone jumps out at once, and you're left gasping for breath. Cameron confesses to having panic attacks and struggling to navigate the public spotlight. It's not all sequined dresses and autographs, folks.

She further weaves in the tragic backstory of her father's suicide just before her big break. One minute she's at his funeral on Bainbridge Island, and the next she’s at The Grove, signing glossies for eager fans. It's like being shuffled from a Shakespearean tragedy to a slapstick comedy without so much as a costume change.

Despite the emotional whirlwind, Cameron found sanctuary on the Disney set, a sort of magical fortress where even the most pimple-filled, angst-ridden teenage years could be kept at bay. It was her escape from the chaotic reality of her personal life, a place where the spotlight felt more like a warm hug than a scalding spotlight.

But, as life has a funny way of reminding us, we can't outrun ourselves forever. Cameron eventually had to confront her mental health, resulting in a journey of self-reflection. She realized that just because she was in touch with her emotions didn't mean she could brush them under the red carpet. She needed to stop, listen to her inner self, and take action for her wellbeing. A tough pill to swallow, but one that's left her in a healthier place, singing her own tune.

So, here's to Dove Cameron, for showing us that behind the glitz and glamour, even Disney princesses are human after all.
