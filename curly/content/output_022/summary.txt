In our glorious leader Donald Trump's gilded era, CEOs across the country are predicting an employment apocalypse due to his tariffs. But fear not, our favorite night-time comedic soothsayer Stephen Colbert may have stumbled upon the one career path impervious to the Trump's reign of economic terror.

Colbert, in his usual charmingly sardonic manner, welcomed viewers to Trump's "Golden Age." Of course, he had his own cheeky translation of "Golden Age." It seems Colbert sees Trump's golden age as more of a golden shower, casually remarking that it feels like our president is urinating down our legs and declaring it emancipation. It's a refreshing image, isn't it?

Speaking of refreshing, Colbert was all aflutter about the nationwide "Hands Off" protests that occurred over the weekend. He found particular joy in the clever, homemade signs protesters brandished. But, even amidst the creative outpouring of public sentiment, Colbert couldn't help but express concern over the hemorrhaging of money due to Trump's tariffs. He painted a vivid image, likening the tariffs to our retirement savings being violently flung down a flight of stairs.

Yet, amidst the gloom and doom, Colbert managed to see a glimmer of hope. He declared that in this treacherous Trump landscape, the one foolproof job is the "guy who takes photos of panicked stock brokers." He took delight in showcasing a medley of his favorite photographs, from "Johnny Head-in-Hands," to the classic "God-has-forsaken-us" pose, and a singularly irate man, who Colbert believes is destined to be the new face of the $100 bill.

Stephen Colbert, as always, manages to make us laugh even as the economic walls crumble around us. He's like a court jester in a collapsing kingdom, throwing out jokes as the castle burns. Oh, how we need that laughter. God bless you, Colbert.
