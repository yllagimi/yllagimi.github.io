Well now, isn't it just dandy to be Michelle Obama? The former first lady, who has been hitched to her former-president husband, Barack, for 32 years, recently decided to break her silence on those pesky divorce rumors. It appears that her decision to start making choices for herself after departing the White House in 2017 had some folks whispering, "divorce."

The gall! A grown woman making decisions for herself? Outrageous! What kind of bizarro world are we living in? Apparently, one where women are expected to constantly please others, otherwise it's divorce bells ringing. But Michelle, bless her, isn't bothered by society's stereotype of what she should do. She's just going to keep being herself, making "big girl decisions" and asking those hard questions like, "Who do I truly want to be every day?" 

No, she's not planning to run off and join a circus (though that would be a sight, wouldn't it?), she's just figuring out what her life looks like now that she's no longer in the public eye. And it includes speeches, projects and probably some fantastic vacations we're not invited to.

Meanwhile, Barack's been busy too, trying to dig himself out of a "deep deficit" with his wife caused by, well, being president. Twice. Now, he's trying to make up for lost time by doing "occasionally fun things." Good on you, Barack. 

I suppose the moral of the story here is that if you're a public figure, people will always jump to conclusions. Just remember, don't let society's stereotypes define you. Make your own choices, even if they lead to rumors of impending divorce. Because at the end of the day, who you are is so much more important than what people think you should be.
