It's a rite of passage for entertainers to have that one moment of monumental regret, an opportunity missed that could have been a game-changer. For Eric André, that was recently aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in all its humiliating glory. Apparently, he turned down the role that Kieran Culkin later accepted and won an Oscar for in the film A Real Pain. André's reasoning? He perused the script, found it "depressing" and waved it away. By the way, the man read like ten pages of it. I mean, who has time to read an entire script? That's like asking someone to enjoy summer school.

André admitted that this decision may have been the Everest of the mountains of mistakes in his career. The film was directed by Jesse Eisenberg, who also starred in it alongside Culkin. André had nothing but praise for the duo. And why wouldn't he? It's always polite to compliment the people who picked up the golden opportunity you tossed aside like a stale bagel.

This wasn't just any Oscar either, oh no, it was Culkin's first nomination and win. He bested other esteemed actors like Yua Borisov, Edward Norton, Guy Pearce, and Jeremy Strong. Even Pearce said, "I’m not gonna win! Kieran will win, again.” And just like a televised Nostradamus, he was right.

Culkin, during his acceptance speech, admitted that his wife, Jazz Charton, promised to give him a third child if he won the Oscar. Because nothing says 'I'm proud of you' like an extra mouth to feed. He even tried to up the ante by asking for a fourth kiddo. “She said, 'I will give you four when you win an Oscar,' " he shared. And, ladies and gentlemen, that's how you negotiate in Hollywood. 

So, there you have it. Eric André passed up an Oscar-winning role because reading the script felt like a summer school assignment. It's just like my mother always said: 'You miss 100% of the shots you never take... or in this case, the scripts you never read.'
