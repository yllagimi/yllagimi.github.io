So, apparently, Stephen Baldwin, cropping up at the Steel City Con in Monroeville, spilled the beans on the secret to his nuptial longevity with wife Kennya. Just to remind you, this is the pair who've been clutching each other's hands through the marital rollercoaster ride since June 10, 1990. That's practically three decades of shared Netflix accounts and arguing over who forgot to buy milk. Their secret? A cocktail of faith, forgiveness, and presumably a tolerance for bad puns, or so Stephen told Michael "Zombo" Devine during a Q&A.

It seems every starry-eyed couple primed to plunge into the abyss of marriage asks him for advice. They come up with all sorts of one-word notions that they believe hold the key to connubial bliss: love, commitment, cherish, honor. But Baldwin throws them a curveball and proffers 'forgiveness.' You can imagine the confused looks as they mentally juggle with the concept.

Born into Catholicism, Stephen conveniently exited stage left from the religion, quipping that he was such a "horrible sinner, it just didn't work." I suppose one way to outfox sin is to simply sidestep the rules. He found his 'forgiveness' mantra during his reincarnation as a born-again Christian.

Stephen and Kennya, only 19 when they met on a bus in NYC in 1987, became a family unit with the arrival of daughters Alaia and Hailey - the latter now better known as Mrs. Bieber. Both girls are strutting their stuff on the modeling catwalks.

Hailey, chatting with 'Elle,' said her parentsâ€™ marriage sounded "like the most romantic thing in the world" when she was a child, which influenced her own hasty sprint up the aisle. Ah, young love, fueled by parental example and, of course, pop stardom. 

So there you have it. If you're searching for the key to a 35-year marriage, it's forgiveness, mixed with a sprinkling of faith and a dash of humor. And if all else fails, there's always Netflix.
