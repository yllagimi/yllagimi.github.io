License to Praise: Pierce Brosnan and the Bond Boy Auditions
By Someone Who’s Never Been Cast as Anything but “Customer #2”

Pierce Brosnan, the James Bond of your mom’s fantasy life, has weighed in on the next potential heir to the double-oh throne. His choice? Aaron Taylor-Johnson, a man who looks like he’d wrestle a grizzly bear shirtless and still smell faintly of lavender. Brosnan says Taylor-Johnson would not just be good, but “very good,” which, coming from a man who’s worn a tuxedo in a moving tank, is the Hollywood equivalent of proposing marriage.

They worked together once, years ago, on a film called The Greatest. Not a boxing movie, surprisingly, but a family drama. Brosnan had executive produced it, which I assume means he walked around holding a latte and occasionally said things like “Can we get a crane shot of his grief?”

Apparently, Taylor-Johnson arrived on set and—according to Pierce—“filled the space with passion and energy,” which sounds either very inspiring or vaguely like what someone says when they don’t remember your name but want to seem supportive.

As for the Bond franchise itself—now under the joint custody of Amazon MGM and the original stewards (which sounds more like a horse breeding agreement than a film deal)—Brosnan offered a diplomatic “I wish them well.” This is what you say when you run into your ex and their new lover at Trader Joe’s and everyone’s pretending not to be dying inside.

In MobLand, Brosnan's new venture into TV, he plays a fierce Irish crime boss who presumably wears well-cut coats and has a lot of brooding thoughts while drinking neat whiskey. He stars opposite Helen Mirren, Tom Hardy, and some poor soul named Anson Boon, who sounds like a Dickens character but is apparently real and very complimentary of Pierce's work ethic.

Brosnan says he and Hardy only exchanged about two hours of dialogue over five months of filming, which might sound sad if you’ve never had a roommate. Still, he respects Hardy, who is not only talented and brooding but also happens to be friends with Brosnan’s son Sean—whom Brosnan refers to as “intense,” “passionate,” and “kind-hearted,” all things you might also say about a particularly noble Rottweiler.

Hardy returns the compliment, calling Brosnan a “consummate pro,” a “lovely man,” and a “brilliant actor”—three phrases that could either describe Pierce Brosnan or a well-designed vacuum cleaner.

Everyone involved with MobLand appears to be very fond of each other, which is nice. It’s good to know that amidst all the gunplay and betrayal and London-based family feuds, there’s warmth behind the scenes. Like Downton Abbey but with more blood and less tea.

And as for Aaron Taylor-Johnson becoming Bond? If Pierce says he can do it, then honestly, why not? He has the jawline. He’s filled a space with energy. And most importantly, he’s already impressed a former Bond, which—let’s face it—is like getting knighted, but sexier.
