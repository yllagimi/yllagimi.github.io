So, Elon Musk and Donald Trump are having a bit of a spat about tariffs. No need to panic, it's not like the world economy hangs on their every word or anything. Trump thinks tariffs are the bee's knees, while Musk wants a zero-tariff system. Honestly, I think Musk would prefer zero taxes, zero employees, and zero rules...just him, a rocket, and Mars.

Anyway, Musky has been hurling insults at Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, calling him a "moron". That's rich, coming from a man who named his kid X Æ A-12. 

Between Musk's VAT complaints and Trump's tariff infatuation, I'm just here, desperately trying to understand what a tariff even is. Maybe I should ask Navarro. Or better yet, X Æ A-12.
