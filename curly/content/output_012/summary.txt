I can't help but chuckle at the melodrama of Wendy Williams' life. Here we have a former television host, who at 60, finds herself thrust into this sitcom scenario of a welfare check, a note thrown out of a window (probably with a brick attached, from what I can tell), and a trip to the hospital for a cognitive evaluation. 

Now, let me just say, if my cognitive test results came back anything other than a glowing review, I'd feel as though I'd failed even the most basic of life's quizzes. Wendy, however, "passed with flying colors" and shared the news on Good Day New York, as if she’d won the Pulitzer. I suppose that's one way to boast about your mental faculties.

So, the plot thickens. Wendy, it seems, finds herself ensnared in a guardianship, her advocate being Sabrina Morrissey, a court-appointed attorney. Now, I don't know about you, but I'd rather trust my well-being to a monkey with a typewriter than a court-appointed attorney. No offense to monkeys. Or typewriters.

Wendy's life has become a self-proclaimed "luxury prison." She’s trapped in an upscale assisted living facility that sounds more like a fortress, with locked elevators and restricted visitors. Honestly, it seems her only connection to the outside world is a carrier pigeon and a window.

Morrissey, the puppet-master in this ordeal, is now under fire for what appears to be some dubious financial decisions. I mean, who sends a millionaire like Wendy on a trip without some cash? Wendy found herself in Miami without a dime. She must have felt like a pauper at a prince's party.

Wendy's not taking this lying down, though. She’s fighting for her freedom and determined to cut the strings of this guardianship. It’s all pretty extreme, rather reminiscent of the #FreeBritney movement a few years back. I'm just waiting for the hashtag #FreeWendy to start trending.

As for the court, well, the wheels of justice turn slowly. They’re still caught up in a maze of processes and paperwork. Quite frankly, it’s a mess. But who knows, maybe Wendy's cries for freedom will finally reach the right ears. Until then, we’ll just have to wait for the next episode of "The Wendy Williams Show."
